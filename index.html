						To whom it may concern,
					<p>
						I am a language and technology specialist currently completing a Higher Diploma in Computing at the National College of Ireland, seeking to apply my combined expertise in linguistics, localization, and software workflows to a role that bridges language and technology.
					<p>
						Over the past several years at Activision Blizzard, I have progressed from QA Localization Tester to Language Specialist, gaining hands-on experience with translation tools, automation, and quality assurance across multiple platforms. I have led linguistic QA projects, implemented process improvements, and developed scripts to optimize repetitive tasks—experience that deepened my interest in computing and inspired me to formalize my technical skills.
					<p>
						My academic background in arts and language studies (including a PhD from Jagiellonian University) has given me strong analytical and communication skills, while my technical experience—ranging from machine translation post-editing to Python scripting—has prepared me to engage confidently with software systems, data pipelines, and AI-driven tools. I am particularly interested in roles that combine localization technology, automation, and applied computing, where I can contribute both linguistic precision and technical problem-solving.
					<p>
						I am eager to join a team that values innovation, clarity, and cross-disciplinary thinking. I bring a proven record of delivering results in fast-paced, international environments and a continuous-learning mindset shaped by both academic and industry experience.
					<p>
						Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background could contribute to your team’s goals.
					<p>
						Kind regards,<br>
						Hubert Zieba
